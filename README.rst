Run Transform Plugin
Introduction

Runs an executable binary which is installed and available on the local filesystem of the Hadoop nodes. Run transform plugin allows the user to read the structured record as input and returns the output record, to be further processed downstream in the pipeline.
Getting Started

Prerequisites

CDAP version 3.5.x or higher.

Building Plugins

You get started with Run transform plugin by building directly from the latest source code:

git clone https://github.com/hydrator/run-transform.git
cd run-transform
mvn clean package
After the build completes, you will have a JAR for each plugin under each <plugin-name>/target/ directory.

Deploying Plugins

You can deploy a plugin using the CDAP CLI:

> load artifact <target/plugin-jar> config-file <resources/plugin-config>

> load artifact target/run-transform-plugin-<version>.jar \
       config-file target/run-transform-plugin-<version>.json
You can build without running tests: mvn clean install -DskipTests

Limitations

UI doesn't support schema's with hyphens (-), so the plugin currently transforms all the schemas with - into underscores (_). This change will be reverted after this is fixed: https://issues.cask.co/browse/HYDRATOR-1125
Mailing Lists

CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:
